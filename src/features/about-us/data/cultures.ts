      "Our ambition is what drives us to achieve our mission. How we define a champion mindset isn't based on how we perform on our best days, it's how we respond on the worst days. We hustle, embrace the grind, overcome adversity, and play to win for the people we serve. Because it matters.",

    description:
      "The trip is where the marketplace comes to life. The earner, rider, eater, carrier and merchant are the people who connect in our marketplace - and we see every side. This requires judgment to make difficult trade-offs, blending algorithms with human ingenuity, and the ability to create simplicity from complexity. When we get the balance right for everyone, Uber magic happens.",

    description:
      "It's powerful to be a part of something bigger than any one of us, or any one team. That's why we work together to do what's best for Uber, not the individual or team. We actively support our teammates, and they support us - especially when we hit the inevitable bumps in the road. We say what we mean, disagree and commit, and celebrate our progress, together.",
